#[SECRET FORMULA]: You are given three variables holding parts of a secret code. Use string slicing and concatenation to reveal the final password.
    # p1, p2, p3= 'abcXYZ', '123456', 'defGHI'; pr1=p1[:3]; pr2=p2[-3:]; pr3=p3[-3:]; code = pr1+pr2+pr3
    # print(f"PASSWORD: {code}")

#[SECRET WORD REARRANGE]:You are given three variables containing words in the wrong order. Rearrange them to form a correct sentence.
    # w1,w2,w3='world','Hello','!'
    # w1,w2,w3=w2, w1, w3
    # print(f"{w1} {w2} {w3}")

#[SECRET WORD REARRANGE 2]: You are given three variables containing words in the wrong order. Rearrange them to form a meaningful sentence.
    # w1, w2, w3 = "learning", "I", "Python"
    # print(f"{w2} am {w1} {w3}!")
    
#[SECRET NUMBER PUZZLE]: You have three variables holding numbers as strings. Rearrange and combine them to make a meaningful number. Your task: rearrange and combine so it prints:  "102457"
    # n1, n2, n3 = "45", "7", "102"
    # print(f"{n3}{n1}{n2}")
