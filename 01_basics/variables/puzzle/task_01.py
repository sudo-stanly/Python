#[SWAP SVALUES]
    # a,b,c = 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'
    # a, b, c = c,a,b
    # print("a: ",a,"\nb: ",b,"\nc: ",c)
    
#[MYSTERY COMBINATION]: You are given 3 variables representing parts of a code. Your job is to rearrange or combine them into a readable secret message.
    # p1 = "the fox"
    # p2 = "quick"
    # p3 = "jumps"
    # w1, w2 = p1.split()

    # Using only variables and string manipulation, print: "the quick fox jumps"
    # print(f"{w1} {p2} {w2} {p3}")
    
#[SECRET SWAP]: You have two variables holding numbers. Swap their values without using a temporary variable. Then print both variables.
    # a,b = 5, 10
    # a , b = b, a
    # print(f"{a}\n{b}")
